**Navigating Depressive Discourse: NLP Analysis of Reddit and Twitter**

This project explores how users express depression on Twitter and Reddit using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). By analyzing linguistic variations through Log Odds Ratio and training Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, we aim to improve depression detection. Our models, leveraging TF-IDF and Empath features, outperform baseline classifiers, revealing distinct linguistic patterns between platforms. Future work includes enhancing feature extraction and developing mental health support tools based on these findings.
